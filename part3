logical -> physical map : page tables
     each process gets a page table
     page size = 2^k
     logical = L
     page # = L/2^k
     offset d = L % 2^k
     


"S m"

   new option. should display system memory information. Frame table with a free frame list.



SPECIFICATIONS

#total size of memory
#max size of process
#size of a page

#Page = 2^k
#total size of memory % Page = 0

=======================

#"A" -> Process size in words
#A.size > total size of memory -> reject
#A.size > size of a page -> reject
#A.size > remaining memory -> JOB POOL

#After memory is released... (Largest that will fit)
#cpu.remaining memory < GREATESTSIZEDJOBPOOLITEM.size -> dispatch from JOB POOL to READY QUEUE

#[device]# -> Starting loc in memory -> logical HEX [0...f]+ 
-> MAP TO PHYSICAL

=======================

# K# -> kill pid # -> free up memory
